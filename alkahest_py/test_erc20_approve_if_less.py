Test for approve_if_less functionality

This test follows the same flow as main.rs, demonstrating:
1. First approval should return transaction hash (no existing allowance)
2. Second approval with same amount should return None (sufficient allowance)
3. Third approval with larger amount should return transaction hash (insufficient allowance)
4. Verify allowances are set correctly
